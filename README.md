```

## Getting Started
1. Place your data in the `data/` directory.
2. Use `notebooks/` for EDA and prototyping.
3. Implement data processing, feature engineering, and model training in `src/`.
4. Add tests in `tests/`.
5. Define CI/CD workflows in `pipelines/`.
6. Use the `Dockerfile` for containerization and deployment.

## Next Steps
- Set up your Python environment and install dependencies.
- Begin with data exploration and feature engineering.
- Develop and evaluate churn prediction models.
- Build and automate the MLOps pipeline for CI/CD.
